# KSADPRO1KU_EXAM_TEMPLATE [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cholewa1992/KSADPRO1KU_EXAM_TEMPLATE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cholewa1992/KSADPRO1KU_EXAM_TEMPLATE)

This is a template for the Advanced Programming 2016 (KSADPRO1KU) Exam. 
Included in the template is the build.sbt file provided by Andrzej WÄ…sowski. 
The library files included are from the exercises and is partly implemented by me, 
there is therefore no guarantee for the correctness of the libraries.

Just replace the `exam_placeholder.scala` with the exam file and you should be good to go.

If you find a mistake then please submit an issue or fork and make a pull request.

Have a nice exam!
